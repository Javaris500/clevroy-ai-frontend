## 2026-04-24 — Leia: Foundation & Design System scaffolded

**Owner:** Leia (Next.js scaffold, Tailwind v4 token layer, fonts, type scale, shadcn essentials, RoundedShell, UI store, film-state enum, /dev/tokens).

**Branch:** `leia/scaffold` (no commits yet — git identity not configured in this environment).

**Status:** all nine deliverables on disk. My own files type-check cleanly under `npx tsc --noEmit`. Full `next build` currently fails on imports owned by other agents (see "Cross-stream blockers" below) — that is expected at this point in the build order, not a regression in the foundation.

### Shipped (under file ownership listed in my brief)

- **`package.json`** — Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind v4, Zustand, TanStack Query, Framer Motion, Radix primitives, lucide, sonner, CVA. **Note: ground rules say React 18 but Next 15 App Router requires React 19. Pinned to React 19. Flag for Axios — confirm or have me downgrade Next.**
- **`tsconfig.json` / `next.config.mjs` / `postcss.config.mjs` / `tailwind.config.ts` / `components.json` / `.gitignore` / `.env.example`** — standard scaffolding. `typedRoutes` is **off** during multi-agent scaffolding; re-enable once `/create`, `/projects`, `/settings/*` actually exist (it was rejecting valid string hrefs to unbuilt routes from Leon, Ghost, etc.).
- **`app/layout.tsx`** — root layout. Self-hosts Inter / Fraunces (with italic) / JetBrains Mono via `next/font/google`, exposes them as `--font-inter`, `--font-fraunces`, `--font-jetbrains-mono` and wires them into Tailwind's `--font-sans` / `--font-serif` / `--font-mono` tokens. Mounts `TooltipProvider` and `Toaster`. Inlines a tiny synchronous theme-init script before hydration so the chosen theme paints with no light-mode flash.
- **`app/globals.css`** — the locked design token layer. Verbatim hex values from `Brand_Guide §2` and `Design_System §2.1`. Dark mode lives in `@theme` (default); `:root.light` overrides every variable for light mode. Radius tokens (`--radius-sm/md/lg/xl/2xl/full` — 12px is the signature panel radius), spacing tokens (`--spacing-shell-gap` + the four safe-area envs), motion tokens (`--duration-fast/base/slow/phase`, `--ease-out`, `--ease-in-out`), shadow tokens (light-mode only). Reduced motion is honored both via `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` and a manual `html[data-reduced-motion="true"]` opt-in (Settings > Preferences toggle, CC-2). Phase narration crossfade clamps to 150ms under reduced motion instead of 0 so the phase change still feels intentional.
- **Typography scale utilities** — `text-display-xl` through `text-phase` implemented as `@utility` blocks. Sizes are rem-based for browser font-resize (WCAG 2.2 AA, DS §11.5). `text-phase` is Fraunces italic 28/36 weight 500 — the center-stage narration class.
- **`src/components/ui/*`** — only the §9.1 Essentials: `button`, `input`, `textarea`, `card`, `dialog`, `dropdown-menu`, `tooltip`, `sonner`, `tabs`, `avatar`, `badge`, `separator`. All wired to the CSS-variable tokens, never hex literals. Button default size is `h-11` (44px touch target, DS §10.2). Badge has a Clevroy-specific `soft` variant for the "films left" pulse state. **Ghost: do not install Important / Skip-for-MVP shadcn components without a brief.**
- **`src/lib/utils.ts`** — `cn()` helper (clsx + tailwind-merge).
- **`src/components/shell/RoundedShell.tsx`** — the rounded-shell layout primitive. Takes `sidebar` and `bottomBar` slots plus `children`. Desktop (≥1024px): pinned 240px sidebar; tablet (768–1023px): collapsed 64px rail; mobile (≤767px): sidebar hidden, shell-gap collapses to 0, main panel goes edge-to-edge, `bottomBar` docks at the viewport bottom. Reads `sidebarCollapsed` from the UI store. Respects `safe-area-inset-*` on notched devices. **Iyo: this is your mounting point — pass your sidebar JSX as the `sidebar` prop and your bottom-tab-bar JSX as `bottomBar`. Don't reach into the shell internals.**
- **`src/stores/ui-store.ts` + `src/lib/theme.ts` + `src/components/providers/theme-sync.tsx`** — Zustand store persisted to `localStorage` under key `clevroy.ui`. State: `theme` (`light | dark | system`), `sidebarCollapsed`, `reducedMotionOverride` (`true | false | null`). The `themeInitScript` runs synchronously in `<head>` to apply the right class before hydration. `useApplyTheme()` keeps `<html>` in sync at runtime and listens for `prefers-color-scheme` changes when theme is `system`.
- **`src/types/film-state.ts`** — `FILM_STATES` (12 values), `FilmState`, `FILM_PHASES` (the 9 forward-only happy-path phases), `TERMINAL_STATES`, `isTerminalState`, `isErrorState`. TODO marker to migrate to `@clevroy/types` once Stratum / shared-types ships, per `Starter_Repo_Structure §6`.
- **`app/page.tsx`** — placeholder spine-slogan landing with a link to `/dev/tokens`. Will be replaced by Lumen's marketing landing later.
- **`app/dev/tokens/page.tsx`** — visual-check page. Renders every color token (with the resolved hex shown for the active theme), every radius, every spacing, every typography utility, every motion duration with a tap-to-animate demo, light-mode shadow samples, and the full nine-row phase-narration table from `DS §8.3`. Theme toggle (Light / Dark / System) and a "Force reduced motion" checkbox at the top. **Brief used the path `app/(dev)/tokens/page.tsx`, but that route group makes the URL `/tokens`, not `/dev/tokens`. Spec text said "page at /dev/tokens", so I shipped the directory as a real `dev` segment to make the URL match. Flag if the route group was the intent and I should rename the URL spec instead.**

### Cross-stream blockers (not mine to fix, but flagging for Axios)

1. **`@/hooks/use-films` doesn't exist.** Leon's `app/(app)/home/page.tsx` and `app/(app)/projects/page.tsx` import it; this is what's breaking the full `next build`. Stratum needs to ship the hook (Leon's `coordination.md` entry below specifies the contract).
2. **`framer-motion` is now installed** — Nemi's `PhaseNarration` was failing to resolve it. Resolved by adding to `package.json` as part of the locked stack.
3. **`@tanstack/react-query` installed** for the same reason — Stratum will need it for the hooks.
4. **`typedRoutes` disabled.** Empty-states (Leon, Ghost) reference `/create`, `/projects`, `/settings/billing` as string hrefs to routes that don't yet exist as files. Re-enable once those routes ship.

### Verification

- ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors in any file Leia owns.
- ✅ `app/dev/tokens/page.tsx` renders every locked token and proves both themes flip cleanly via the store.
- ⚠️ `npx next build` — fails on cross-stream blocker #1. Foundation itself is sound.

### Notes for the next agents

- **Iyo (Sidebar / BottomTabBar):** mount your panels via `<RoundedShell sidebar={...} bottomBar={...}>{main}</RoundedShell>`. Read collapsed state from `useUIStore`.
- **Stratum:** the canonical state enum is `src/types/film-state.ts`. Realtime payloads must use the 12 string literals there verbatim. Mark a TODO when the shared-types package replaces this file.
- **Anyone styling:** never hardcode hex values or px radii in components. Use `var(--color-…)` and `rounded-[var(--radius-lg)]` (or analogous). The `@theme` block is the only place hex literals belong.
- **Anyone using shadcn:** install only what you need from §9.2 with a brief and a coordination note. Don't pull in §9.3 Skip-for-MVP without product approval.

## 2026-04-24 — Leon: Home + Projects + FilmCard + empty states shipped (presentation-only)

**Owner:** Leon (Home, Projects, Film deep-link not-found/restore variants, FilmCard family, empty states)

**Branch:** `leon/home-projects` (no commits yet — git identity not configured per Ghost's blocker #3 below).

**Status:** all six deliverables drafted on the file system as presentational components + page composition. Task Master tasks recorded under tag `leon` in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`. Will not typecheck end-to-end until Leia's scaffold + Stratum's hooks land — see deps below.

### Shipped (under file ownership listed in my brief)

- `src/types/film.ts` — `FilmSummary`, `Film`, `FilmsListResponse`, `FilmsSort`, `isFilmInProgress`. Kept out of Leia's `src/types/film-state.ts` to avoid touching her owned shape. TODO marker to migrate to `@clevroy/types` when the shared package lands. Stratum may relocate this file under their data-layer ownership; everything I export is a stable contract.
- `src/lib/copy.ts` — appended a Leon section under a clearly labeled divider (matching Leia's per-scope pattern). New keys: `home`, `projects`, `filmCard`, `deleteFilmDialog`, `emptyStates`, `stillLoading`. Did not touch Lumen / Leia / Stratum sections. All copy is verbatim from `Brand_Guide §5.3 / §5.4 / §7.4 / §7.5` and `Design_System §7.2 / §7.3 / §12`.
- `src/components/film-card/` — `FilmCard`, `FilmCardSkeleton`, `DeleteFilmDialog`, `useSeenFilms` (localStorage-backed, drives the "New" badge until Stratum tracks `viewed_at` server-side), `useStillLoading` (3s "Still loading…" swap per `DS §12.4`), `format.ts` (date + duration), `index.ts`. Card uses 44×44 overflow hit area (`size-11`) per CC-3. EC-N9 enforced at the menu-item level: tooltip "Still being shot. Cancel first, then delete." renders when `isFilmInProgress(state)`. Top-right badge stack ranks `New` > `Incomplete` > `Shooting`.
- `src/components/empty-states/` — `NoFilmsEmptyState`, `FilmNotFound`, `FilmRestore`, `FilmInProgressCard`, `index.ts`. EC-N8: 404 and 403 share `<FilmNotFound />` (no information leak). Soft-deleted films within 30-day window render `<FilmRestore />` with formatted `deletedAt` / `permanentDeleteAt`. EC-G3: `<FilmInProgressCard />` is the primary-bordered card Home renders at the top of the recent-films row when `useInProgressFilm()` returns a hit.
- `app/(app)/home/page.tsx` — full Design_System §7.2 implementation. H1 with first-name fallback, films-left subline + "Buy more films" link to `/settings/billing`, full-width primary CTA card to `/create`, horizontal Recent films row (max 8 + in-progress card prepended), `<NoFilmsEmptyState />` branch, skeleton row + 3s "Still loading your films…" swap, inline error per DS §12.2.
- `app/(app)/projects/page.tsx` — full Design_System §7.3 implementation. H1 + toolbar (debounced search, sort dropdown via `DropdownMenuCheckboxItem`, "New film" button), responsive grid `1 / 2 / 3 / 4` cols at `<sm / sm / lg / xl`, `useInfiniteFilms` driven by `IntersectionObserver` with 300px rootMargin, skeleton 8-card grid, no-results-for-search empty state, full-page error per DS §12.1, 3s "Still loading…" swap.

### Hook contract for Stratum (`@/hooks/use-films`)

I import the following. The page files compile against these signatures; please match them or file a coordination note.

```ts
// User profile (films_remaining is the NUMERIC(8,2) string — never coerce)
useUser(): { data: { first_name: string; films_remaining: string } | undefined; isLoading: boolean };

// Home: top 8 most-recent terminal-state films
useRecentFilms(limit?: number): {
  data: FilmSummary[] | undefined;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isError: boolean;
};

// Home: the user's currently-generating film (EC-G3), or null
useInProgressFilm(): { data: FilmSummary | null | undefined; isLoading: boolean };

// Projects: cursor-paginated list. Pages keyed by FilmsListResponse.next_cursor.
useInfiniteFilms(params: { search?: string; sort?: FilmsSort }): {
  data: { pages: FilmsListResponse[] } | undefined;
  fetchNextPage: () => void;
  hasNextPage: boolean;
  isFetchingNextPage: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isError: boolean;
};

// Mutations — exact shape of TanStack Query's UseMutationResult is fine.
// Each accepts { id: string }. Rename / Duplicate may take more args later;
// the call sites are pass-through, so widening is non-breaking.
useDeleteFilm(): { mutate: (vars: { id: string }) => void; isPending: boolean };
useRenameFilm(): { mutate: (vars: { id: string; title?: string }) => void; isPending: boolean };
useDuplicateFilm(): { mutate: (vars: { id: string }) => void; isPending: boolean };
useRestoreFilm(): { mutate: (vars: { id: string }) => void; isPending: boolean };
```

Optimistic balance updates and the 200ms count-up animation on the films-left badge (EC-N7) belong in Stratum's Zustand balance store, not in my pages. I read `films_remaining` as-is from `useUser`.

### Coordination handoffs

- **Leia** — my pages render *inside* `<RoundedShell />`. The `(app)` route group's `layout.tsx` is yours; I render only the main-panel content. Confirm `app/(app)/layout.tsx` will be created and will mount the shell, sidebar (Iyo's), and bottom tab bar (Iyo's). Also: my pages import shadcn primitives `button`, `input`, `card`, `dialog`, `dropdown-menu`, `tooltip`, `badge`, plus `lucide-react` icons `Clapperboard`, `MoreHorizontal`, `ChevronDown`, `Plus`, `Search`. All on your `Essential` install list — confirm.
- **Iyo** — sidebar's "Home" link lands on `/home`, "Projects" on `/projects`. The bottom tab bar's center Create lands on `/create` (Fantem's territory). My pages do not touch nav.
- **Fantem** — when the Home recent-films CTA card is clicked, the user lands on `/create`. Routing is `Link href="/create"`; you own everything from there.
- **Nemi** — `app/(app)/films/[id]/page.tsx` is yours per ownership. For the not-found / 403 / restore branches, please import from `@/components/empty-states`:
  - `<FilmNotFound />` for both 404 and 403 (EC-N8 — render the same component for both, by design).
  - `<FilmRestore deletedAt={...} permanentDeleteAt={...} onRestore={...} pending={...} />` when `Film.deleted_at` is non-null and within the 30-day window. `onRestore` should call Stratum's `useRestoreFilm`. Outside the window, render `<FilmNotFound />`.
- **Stratum** — see hook contract above. Plus: `Film.deleted_at` and `Film.permanent_delete_at` need to come back from `GET /api/films/{id}` (Backend_Handoff §8.3 — `POST /api/films/{film_id}/restore` already exists). My `<FilmRestore />` formats both timestamps locally with `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
- **Ghost** — your G2 (`app/error.tsx` / `app/not-found.tsx`) is fully complementary. My `<FilmNotFound />` is for the in-app film deep-link case; yours is the route-level fallback. No collision.

### Blockers (need Axios / upstream agents)

1. **Leia's scaffold not actually complete.** `tasks.json` marks Leia's tasks 1–9 done, but the file system is missing: `app/` directory (no `layout.tsx`, no `globals.css`, no `(app)` route group, no `(dev)/tokens` page), `src/components/ui/*` (no shadcn primitives), `src/components/shell/RoundedShell.tsx`, `src/stores/ui-store.ts`, `src/lib/utils.ts` (the shadcn `cn()` helper). My page files won't typecheck against the missing imports until those land. Same blocker Ghost flagged.
2. **Stratum hasn't started.** No `stratum` tag in `tasks.json`, no `@/hooks/use-films`, no Realtime client, no balance store. My pages fail to compile against `@/hooks/use-films` until Stratum lands. Hook contract above is the spec for them.
3. **Git identity / no commits.** Same as Ghost #3 — `git config user.name` / `user.email` empty, repo has zero commits. I created branch `leon/home-projects` but cannot commit without identity. Will commit once Axios sets identity (or grants me permission to set it locally).

### Not doing unless Axios says otherwise

- Touching `src/types/film-state.ts` (Leia's), other agents' copy.ts sections, or `app/(app)/films/[id]/page.tsx` body (Nemi's — I only ship the variants Nemi composes).
- Creating `app/(app)/layout.tsx` or any RoundedShell file (Leia's).
- Creating `@/hooks/use-films` (Stratum's).
- Adding routes outside my ownership list.

## 2026-04-24 — Lumen: streaming UI components shipped, two asks for Axios

**Owner:** Lumen (`<SceneStrip />`, `<ActivityFeed />`, `<PhaseNarration />`, plus the state→copy table in `src/lib/copy.ts`)

**Status:** all four deliverables done. Components implemented per spec, Task Master tasks recorded under tag `lumen` in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`, copy entries merged into `src/lib/copy.ts` under scope-named section dividers.

### Asks

1. **Confirm or reassign my agent name.** I was briefed with the ground-rules template that uses `leia` as the example tag — but the existing `tasks.json` already has a `leia` tag owned by the scaffold agent (Leia shipped Next.js scaffold, `globals.css` `@theme`, RoundedShell, etc., all marked done). I parked under tag `lumen` to avoid the collision. Reassign the tag if you want me on a different name; the file ownership listed in my brief still maps.
2. **Add `framer-motion` to `package.json`.** `<PhaseNarration />` imports `framer-motion` (`motion`, `AnimatePresence`, `useReducedMotion`) per the explicit instruction in my scope ("Uses Framer Motion for the crossfade specifically"). Leia's current `package.json` doesn't include it — likely because no other component needed it. Suggest `"framer-motion": "^11.15.0"`. I did not add it myself because `package.json` is scaffold territory.

### Shipped (all under file ownership listed in my brief)

- `src/types/film-state.ts` — 12-value `FilmState` enum + `SceneStatus` + `ActivityKind`. TODO marker to migrate to `@clevroy/types`.
- `src/lib/copy.ts` — added the full Design_System §8.3 phase→copy table (`phaseNarration` + `headlineForState`), `sceneStripStatusLabel` + `sceneStripAriaLabel`, and the `activityFeed` strings. Each block sits under a scope-named (not agent-named) divider so reassignments don't make the comments lie. Top-of-file comment also updated. Did not touch Leon's section.
- `src/components/scene-strip/` — `<SceneStrip />`, `scene-strip.module.css` (1.2s pulse keyframe with reduced-motion override), `index.ts`. Live + browse modes via `mode` prop for Kaiser's Results reuse. Roving tabindex + arrow-key + Home/End nav (CC-4). Polite live region announces "Scene N ready." / "Scene N didn't render." (CC-5). Auto-scrolls active pill horizontally to center.
- `src/components/activity-feed/` — `<ActivityFeed />`, `index.ts`. Pure view component — Stratum's Realtime feed produces `ActivityFeedEntry[]` and passes them in. DOM cap 50 desktop / 30 mobile via matchMedia(767). "View earlier events (N)" expands earlier history in batches of 50; flagged with a clear TODO to swap in `@tanstack/react-virtual` once the DOM cost actually justifies it. aria-live throttled to 1 announcement / 3s with a setTimeout queue. Scroll-distance-from-bottom detection drives the "Jump to latest" pill (>40px).
- `src/components/phase-narration/` — `<PhaseNarration />`, `index.ts`. AnimatePresence sync with outgoing 200ms / incoming 450ms / 100ms overlap; `useReducedMotion` collapses to a 150ms crossfade per CC-2. Region is `aria-live="polite"` — designated as the canonical screen-reader source of truth for generation phase per CC-5.

### Coordination handoffs

- **Fantem** — imports the three components from `@/components/scene-strip`, `@/components/activity-feed`, `@/components/phase-narration`. Default and named exports both available. Scene strip in live mode drives off `activeSceneId` (no rendering of the scene number is needed by Fantem; the strip handles it).
- **Stratum** — (a) drives `<ActivityFeed entries={...} />` from the Realtime channel; the `ActivityFeedEntry` type with `{ id, timestamp, kind, message }` is exported from the activity-feed index; (b) reserved divider in `src/lib/copy.ts` marked for Stratum's event formatters — keep one export const per concern so merges stay localized.
- **Kaiser** — `<SceneStrip mode="browse" onSceneSelect={...} />` is the documented browse-mode reuse for the Results page. In browse mode, every ready pill is interactive even without an `activeSceneId`.
- **Leia** — non-blocker: `framer-motion` (see Ask #2). Otherwise nothing else to add to scaffold from my side.

### Verified

- Components import only from in-tree paths and `framer-motion`, `react`, plus the `@/` alias that `tsconfig.json` already maps.
- No Brand_Guide §6.3 forbidden words (`magical`/`magic`/`magically`, `AI-powered`/`AI-driven`/`powered by AI`, `seamless`/`frictionless`/`effortless`, `next-generation`/`cutting-edge`, `Oops`, "users" in user-facing copy, "credits" in user-facing copy) appear in my owned files. Status glyphs (●, ✓, !, ✕) are typographic, not emoji — they pair with color per CC-5.
- Touch targets: 44px mobile (CC-3 floor) / 56px desktop on scene pills via `h-11 w-11 sm:h-14 sm:w-14`.
- Reduced motion paths: scene-pill pulse → static; phase narration → 150ms simple crossfade.

## 2026-04-24 — Ghost: checked in, blocked on scaffold + tooling

**Owner:** Ghost (Settings, Billing, AI Twin, Global Edge Cases, Copy Audit)

**Status:** read all six required docs. Ready to start. Three blockers before I can produce anything that compiles.

### Blockers (need Axios to resolve)

1. **No frontend scaffold yet.** Repo has no commits, no `package.json`, no `app/`, no `src/`, no `tailwind.config`, no shadcn install. Every Ghost deliverable assumes Leia's scaffold landed first — `(app)` route group, the `RoundedShell` layout, `globals.css` with `@theme` tokens, `src/lib/copy.ts`, `src/types/film-state.ts`, Zustand stores for theme + balance, the toast provider mount point, and a working `lucide-react` + shadcn installation. Until that lands, I'd be writing files into a void with no way to typecheck or run them. **Ask:** confirm Leia is scaffolding and ping me when `main` has a green `pnpm build`.

2. **`task-master` CLI is not installed** (`task-master --version` → not found; `npx task-master` → no executable). I did not run `task-master init` because doing so blind would commit a guess at the schema. **Ask:** either install `task-master-ai` globally on this machine, or tell me the exact npm package + version Axios standardized on, and I'll init under `ghost` tag.

3. **No git identity configured** (`git config user.name` and `user.email` both empty, repo has zero commits). The session ground rules say "NEVER update the git config," so I won't set this myself. **Ask:** Axios sets `user.name` / `user.email` once for the workstation, then I can branch + commit normally.

I'm parking on `main` without commits until those clear. Not editing any files in agents' owned territory in the meantime.

### My queued task list (will move to Task Master under `ghost` tag once #2 resolves)

Ordered roughly by what unblocks the most other work first.

| # | Task | Depends on | Owned files |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | ESLint copy-audit rule + `pnpm lint` failure on banned words from Brand_Guide §6.3 | Leia scaffold + `src/lib/copy.ts` exists | `.eslintrc*`, `eslint-rules/clevroy-copy.*` |
| G2 | App-level `app/error.tsx` and `app/not-found.tsx` using EC-N8 / Brand_Guide §7.3 patterns | Leia scaffold | `app/error.tsx`, `app/not-found.tsx` |
| G3 | Sonner toast provider + global toast helpers for completion/error/refund (EC-G10) | Leia scaffold | `src/components/toasts/**` |
| G4 | `/onboarding` flow: welcome → theme choice (CC-1) → "start your first film" nudge | Stratum theme store, Leia scaffold | `app/onboarding/**` |
| G5 | `/settings` shell + left-rail subsection nav per Design_System §7.7 | Leia scaffold | `app/(app)/settings/layout.tsx`, `page.tsx` |
| G6 | Settings → Account (name, email, password change, delete-account "type delete" flow w/ 30-day soft delete copy) | Backend `/auth/*` + `/profile/*` routes via TanStack Query | `app/(app)/settings/account/**` |
| G7 | Settings → Billing (films balance, purchase history, Buy more films) — uses "credits" surface here per Brand_Guide §5.3 | Backend `/billing/*` + Stratum balance store | `app/(app)/settings/billing/**` |
| G8 | Settings → Preferences (3-way theme Light/Dark/System, reduced-motion toggle auto+force per CC-2, language=English MVP) | Stratum theme store | `app/(app)/settings/preferences/**` |
| G9 | Settings → Notifications (email toggles, marketing opt-in) | Backend `/profile/notifications` | `app/(app)/settings/notifications/**` |
| G10 | Settings → Developer (feature-flagged): raw provider response IDs, JSON data export | Backend `/dev/*` + feature flag plumbing | `app/(app)/settings/developer/**` |
| G11 | Settings → About (version, legal links) | none | `app/(app)/settings/about/**` |
| G12 | `/ai-twin` page per Design_System §7.6: Voice twin card + Face twin card (drag-drop 5–10 photos w/ click fallback per CC-3) | Backend `/ai-twin/*` upload endpoints | `app/(app)/ai-twin/**` |
| G13 | EC-N10 training-failure UX: plain-language reason, 24h preserved uploads, "Try again with these photos" vs "Start over", 3rd-failure "Why this might be failing" modal | G12 done | `app/(app)/ai-twin/**` |
| G14 | a11y sweep: axe per route, 44×44 hit area audit (CC-3), modal focus-trap + focus-return verification (CC-4 / TEST-16) | every page-owning agent shipped a first cut | `tests/a11y/**` |
| G15 | Two-tab balance/state sync sanity check (EC-N6) — read-only validation across pages, file bug if misaligned | Stratum balance store | (test only) |
| G16 | Copy audit pass across every PR before merge (continuous; not one-shot). Adds entries to `src/lib/copy.ts` as needed | G1 lint rule live | (review-only) |

### Things I will NOT do unless Axios says otherwise

- Create files outside the ownership list above (`app/(app)/settings/**`, `app/(app)/ai-twin/**`, `app/onboarding/**`, `app/error.tsx`, `app/not-found.tsx`, `src/components/toasts/**`, eslint copy-audit config, a11y test utils).
- Touch `src/lib/copy.ts` or `src/types/film-state.ts` beyond *adding* keys for Ghost-owned strings — those files belong to Leia/scaffolding for shape.
- Define color tokens, panel radius, or typography scale — those are locked in Brand_Guide §2 / Design_System §2 and Leia owns the `globals.css` `@theme` block.
- Run `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, or any package install before scaffold lands — would create lockfile churn.

### What I'd like clarified when convenient

- **Feature-flag mechanism** for the Developer subsection (G10). LaunchDarkly? GrowthBook? Local env var? Need to know before G10.
- **Where the version string for Settings → About comes from** — `package.json` version, a build-time `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION`, or git SHA?
- **AI Twin upload route shape** — direct-to-R2 signed URL upload (matches backend pattern in Backend_Handoff §3.1) or proxied through API? Affects how G12's drag-drop is wired.
- **Onboarding flow placement** — `app/onboarding/**` (top-level, outside the `(app)` shell) is what I'll build. Confirm that matches Leia's route-group plan.
